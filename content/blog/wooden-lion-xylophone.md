I bet at an 18 month old absolutely leathering the crap out of a wood xylophone is brilliant.  With two hammer and a happy lion face, this looks great.  It's a bit wierd that the child is basically going to be hammering on the lions ribs but... that's not for us to judge right now.

Rest assured that there's no batteries to run out either, they can bash away for hours on this, hours after you've left and their parents are cursing the ground you walk on.
