I'm trying to find toys that aren't yet more plastic tat to eventually be thrown away.  Wood is a lovely material and durable too, so kids will irritiale their parents endlessly with it.

This looks smashing. It's probably noisy. It's got a hammer.  It's got to be manually reset so you can't even leave them with it whilst you get on with other things.  I mean, even the description is goood

Nobody ever made a quiet toy and used the word "pound" to descibe it, right?
